Abstract. Self-supervised learning (SSL) allows to learn useful repre- sentations from unlabeled data and has been applied effectively for do- main adaptation (DA) on images. It is still unknown if and how it can be leveraged for domain adaptation for 3D perception. Here we describe the first study of SSL for DA on point-clouds. We introduce a new pretext task, Region Reconstruction, motivated by the deformations encountered in sim-to-real transformation. We also demonstrate how it can be com- bined with a training procedure motivated by the MixUp method. Eval- uations on six domain adaptations across synthetic and real furniture data, demonstrate large improvement over previous work."> Abstract</a>

Research in this area has focused on the case where elements of the set are represented by feature vectors, and far less emphasis has been given to the common case where set elements themselves adhere to certain symmetries. That case is relevant to numerous applications, from deblurring image bursts to multi-view 3D shape recognition and reconstruction. In this paper, we present a principled approach to learning sets of general symmetric elements. We first characterize the space of linear layers that are equivariant both to element reordering and to the inherent symmetries of elements, like translation in the case of images. We further show that networks that are composed of these layers, called Deep Sets for Symmetric elements layers (DSS), are universal approximators of both invariant and equivariant functions. DSS layers are also straightforward to implement. Finally, we show that they improve over existing set-learning architectures in a series of experiments with images, graphs, and point-clouds"> Abstract</a>

              <a class="btn btn-default abstract" ptitle="Efficient numerical solvers for sparse linear systems are crucial in science and engineering. One of the fastest methods for solving large-scale sparse linear systems is algebraic multigrid (AMG). The main challenge in the construction of AMG algorithms is the selection of the prolongation operator--a problem-dependent sparse matrix which governs the multiscale hierarchy of the solver and is critical to its efficiency. Over many years, numerous methods have been developed for this task, and yet there is no known single right answer except in very special cases. Here we propose a framework for learning AMG prolongation operators for linear systems with sparse symmetric positive (semi-) definite matrices. We train a single graph neural network to learn a mapping from an entire class of such matrices to prolongation operators, using an efficient unsupervised loss function. Experiments on a broad class of problems demonstrate improved convergence rates compared to classical AMG, demonstrating the potential utility of neural networks for developing sparse system solvers."> Abstract</a>

Examples include clustering, learning vertex and edge features on graphs, and learning triplet data in a collection. Current neural network models that approximate Set2Graph functions come from two main ML sub-fields: equivariant learning, and similarity learning. Equivariant models would be in general computationally challenging or even infeasible, while similarity learning models can be shown to have limited expressive power. In this paper we suggest a neural network model family for learning Set2Graph functions that is both practical and of maximal expressive power (universal), that is, can approximate arbitrary continuous Set2Graph functions over compact sets. Testing our models on different machine learning tasks, including an application to particle physics, we find them favorable to existing baselines."> Abstract</a>

                <a class="btn btn-default abstract" ptitle="Recently, the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test was used to measure the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNN). It was shown that the popular message passing GNN cannot distinguish between graphs that are indistinguishable by the 1-WL test (Morris et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019). Unfortunately, many simple instances of graphs are indistinguishable by the 1-WL test. In search for more expressive graph learning models we build upon the recent k-order invariant and equivariant graph neural networks (Maron et al., 2019a,b) and present two results: First, we show that such k-order networks can distinguish between non-isomorpic graphs as good as the k-WL tests, which are provably stronger than the 1-WL test for k > 2. This makes these models strictly stronger than message passing models. Unfortunately, the higher expressiveness of these models comes with a computational cost of processing high order tensors. Second, setting our goal at building a provably stronger, simple and scalable model we show that a reduced 2-order network containing just scaled identity operator, augmented with a single quadratic operation (matrix multiplication) has a provable 3-WL expressive power. Differently put, we suggest a simple model that interleaves applications of standard Multilayer-Perceptron (MLP) applied to the feature dimension and matrix multiplication. We validate this model by presenting state of the art results on popular graph classification and regression tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical invariant/equivariant model with guaranteed 3-WL expressiveness, strictly stronger than message passing models. "> Abstract</a>

Thus, methods for controlling the neural level sets could find many applications in machine learning. In this paper we present a simple and scalable approach to directly control level sets of a deep neural network. Our method consists of two parts: (i) sampling of the neural level sets, and (ii) relating the samples’ positions to the network parameters. The latter is achieved by a sample network that is constructed by adding a single fixed linear layer to the original network. In turn, the sample network can be used to incorporate the level set samples into a loss function of interest. We have tested our method on three different learning tasks:  raining networks robust to adversarial attacks, improving generalization to unseen data, and curve and surface reconstruction from point clouds. Notably, we increase robust accuracy to the level of standard classification accuracy in off-the-shelf networks, improving it by 2% in MNIST and 27% in CIFAR10 compared to state-of-the-art methods. For surface reconstruction, we produce high fidelity surfaces directly from raw 3D point clouds."> Abstract</a>

Namely, the map wraps around the surface several times, making sure that every part of the surface is well represented in the image. Differently from previous surface-to-image representations we provide a low distortion coverage of all surface parts in a single image.

We tackle the rather general case where $G\leq S_n$ (an arbitrary subgroup of the symmetric group) that acts on $\R^n$ by permuting coordinates. This setting includes several recent popular invariant networks. We present two main results: First, $G$-invariant networks are universal if high-order tensors are allowed. Second, there are groups $G$ for which higher-order tensors are unavoidable for obtaining universality. $G$-invariant networks consisting of only first-order tensors are of special interest due to their practical value. We conclude the paper by proving a necessary condition for the universality of $G$-invariant networks that incorporate only first-order tensors."> Abstract</a>

In this paper, we provide a characterization of all permutation invariant and equivariant linear layers for (hyper-)graph data, and show that their dimension, in case of edge-value graph data, is 2 and 15, respectively. More generally, for graph data defined on k-tuples of nodes, the dimension is the k-th and 2k-th Bell numbers. Orthogonal bases for the layers are computed, including generalization to multi-graph data. The constant number of basis elements and their characteristics allow successfully applying the networks to different size graphs. From the theoretical point of view, our results generalize and unify recent advancement in equivariant deep learning.  Applying these new linear layers in a simple deep neural network framework is shown to achieve comparable results to state-of-the-art and to have better expressivity than previous invariant and equivariant bases."> Abstract</a>

				<a class="btn btn-default abstract" ptitle="Sinkhorn Algorithm for Lifted Assignment Problems" abstract="Recently, Sinkhorn&#39;s algorithm was applied for solving regularized linear programs emerging from optimal transport very efficiently. Sinkhorn&#39;s algorithm is an efficient method of projecting a positive matrix onto the polytope of doubly-stochastic matrices. It is based on alternating closed-form Bregman projections on the larger polytopes of row-stochastic and column-stochastic matrices. In this paper we generalize the Sinkhorn projection algorithm to higher dimensional polytopes originated from well-known lifted linear program relaxations of the Markov Random Field (MRF) energy minimization problem and the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). We derive a closed-form projection on one-sided local polytopes which can be seen as a high-dimensional, generalized version of the row/column-stochastic polytopes. We then use these projections to devise a provably convergent algorithm to solve regularized linear program relaxations of MRF and QAP. Furthermore, as the regularization is decreased both the solution and the optimal energy value converge to that of the respective linear program. The resulting algorithm is considerably more scalable than standard linear solvers and is able to solve significantly larger linear programs. "> Abstract</a>

The point cloud convolution is computationally efficient, invariant to the order of points in the point cloud, robust to different samplings and varying densities, and translation invariant, that is the same convolution kernel is used at all points.

				<a class="btn btn-default abstract" ptitle="DS++: A Flexible, Scalable and Provably Tight Relaxation for Matching Problems" abstract="Correspondence problems are often modelled as quadratic optimization problems over permutations. Common scalable methods for approximating solutions of these NP-hard problems are the spectral relaxation for non-convex energies and the doubly stochastic (DS) relaxation for convex energies. Lately, it has been demonstrated that semidefinite programming relaxations can have considerably improved accuracy at the price of a much higher computational cost.We present a convex quadratic programming relaxation which is provably stronger than both DS and spectral relaxations, with the same scalability as the DS relaxation. The derivation of the relaxation also naturally suggests a projection method for achieving meaningful integer solutions which  improves upon the standard closest-permutation projection. Our method can be easily extended to optimization over doubly stochastic matrices, partial or injective matching, and problems with additional linear constraints. We employ recent advances in optimization of linear-assignment type problems to achieve an efficient algorithm for solving the convex relaxation.We present experiments indicating that our method is  more accurate than local minimization or competing relaxations for non-convex problems. We successfully apply our algorithm to shape matching and to the problem of ordering images in a grid, obtaining results which compare favorably with state of the art methods.

One of the main challenges in applying CNNs to surfaces is defining a natural convolution operator on surfaces. In this paper we present a method for applying deep learning to spheretype shapes using a global seamless parameterization to a planar flat-torus, for which the convolution operator is well defined. As a result, the standard deep learning framework can be readily applied for learning semantic, highlevel properties of the shape. An indication of our success in bridging the gap between images and surfaces is the fact that our algorithm succeeds in learning semantic information from an input of raw low-dimensional feature vectors. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by presenting two applications: human body segmentation, and automatic landmark detection on anatomical surfaces. We show that our algorithm compares favorably with competing geometric deep-learning algorithms for segmentation tasks, and is able to produce meaningful correspondences on anatomical surfaces where hand-crafted features are bound to fail.

High dimensional PM problems are difficult non-convex problems which currently can  only be solved locally using iterative closest point (ICP) algorithms or similar methods. So far, good initialization for the local algorithms was obtained by relying on user input. We introduce a novel and efficient convex SDP relaxation for the PM problem. We prove that for (generic) isometric or almost-isometric problems the algorithm returns a correct global solution of the problem. We show our algorithm gives state of the art results on popular shape matching datasets. We also show that our algorithm gives state of the art results for anatomical classification of shapes.
